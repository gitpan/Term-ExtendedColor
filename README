BLURB

  Term::ExtendedColor provides functions for sending so called extended escape
  sequences, most notably colors. It can be used to set the current text
  attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset the current
  text attributes at the end of the string.

DESCRIPTION

  This module does (almost) the same thing as the core Term::ANSIColor module,
  plus a little more. First off, as the name suggests, it handles the extended
  colorset - that means, the ANSI colors plus 240 extra colors, building up a
  matrix of a total of 256 colors.

  Exported are functions for setting the foreground as well as background
  colors. Other attributes are supported as well - bold, italic, underline and
  reverse.

  There are support for doing the reverse thing - uncolor data; strip it from
  escape sequences.

  Support is included for redefining colors - use with care, though.

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features and usage.

REQUIREMENTS

  Term::ExtendedColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
